## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am Degun, a random Rhino doing OSINT stuff.

Here you can find some use~~less~~full script mainly un Python and CTFd Plugins.

I am the CEO/Analyst in chief/accountant/Sales manager/Creative Director of [Manufacture FranÃ§aise d'Osint](https://manufacture-osint.fr) (meaning I work alone) and also a membre of [Oscar Zulu Osint Crew](https://oscarzulu.org).
